                Welcome to TopoCity! TopoCity was developed by Christian J. Harris (1999) and Richard Giang (2000) who both attend the Ohio State University. Christian is a city and regional planning student while Richard is studying Human Computer-Interaction. This page was developed as part of a creative coding class taught through OSU's art department (ART 3001). The class was co-instructed by Hirad Sab and Dalena Tran.

                This webpage was developed with the idea that there is a distinct difference between what each person perceives from their own position and perspective. The effects of white privilege and the discrimination of minorities and BIPOC are clear even when llustrated with maps made with census data from 2019. This provides evidence towards how much work we have to do, to close the gap between those with privilige and those without. The first city we chose to demonstrate this with, is our home city of Columbus, OH. Columbus is a great city to work, study, and live, but we know there are both visible and invisible issues with our city. Columbus is one of the cities in the United States that still has a very strongly evident gap between the institution of white supremacy and the systemic examples of a history of racial inequities. This is due to the historical redlining of Columbus and the continued use of racist and discriminatory housing practices and policies throughout Columbus' history.

                While we would like to highlight the bad parts, we needed to show some of the good things about Columbus in order to really show the dichotomy between what we percieve and what is actually there.
